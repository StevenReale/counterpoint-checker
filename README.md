# Counterpoint Checker

This repository is an experiment in agent-driven development.

The primary goal is to use an AI coding agent to iteratively design, build, and refine a small music-theory web app while testing workflows, prompting style, and instruction quality.

## Current App Scope

- React + TypeScript web app
- Grand staff input for two voices
- Key signature selection
- Whole-note first-species workflow
- JSON-configurable first-species lint rules

## Local Development

- Install: `npm install`
- Run dev server: `npm run dev`
- Build: `npm run build`
- Test: `npm run test`

## Notes

Project instructions for the agent are maintained in `AGENTS.md`.
